Hey! Glad you found me. I'm Marcel, live at Lake Constance in Southern Germany and I'm working as a full-stack software developer. Besides work, I spend my time with triathlon training, coaching other athletes and constantly searching for new challenges and new knowledge.

As you might see from checking out my repos, I'm working on all kinds of different projects. My current focuses are ASP.NET (Core) MVC Web Development and Android, but I love to get involved with all kinds of topics and I can barely manage to leave a technical device in its original state. For example, I've jailbroken my Kindle and PSP, all of my phones are rooted and run custom roms, my iPod Classic is running Linux and my MacBook runs on ArchLinux. I'm also doing some 3D-printing on the side but I don't have as much time for that right now as I'd like. Anyways - If you're interested in knowing more, check out my [website](https://www.mjurtz.com), my [blog](https://www.blog.mjurtz.com) or just contact me directly:
